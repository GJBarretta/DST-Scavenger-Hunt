add your items within the curley brackets up above 

use the item's prefab name, not the inspection name that you see in game

prefab names can be found here:
http://dont-starve-game.wikia.com/wiki/Console/Prefab_List

only inventory items and structures will be included

put quotes around each prefab name and a comma at the end like this:
customList = 
{
"example1",
"example2",
"example3",
}

if there are items in the curley brackets, then they will be 
added to the pool of potential items that are chosen randomly
